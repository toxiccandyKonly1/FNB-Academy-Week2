# FNB-Academy-Week2
I have Learned CSS basics while building clean, styled web pages. Explore fonts, colours, menus, lists, and div containers. Used external stylesheets to keep designs organized, and added images for visual impact. Perfect for beginners ready to apply real HTML &amp; CSS skills creatively.
CSS Styling Practice — Week 2 Task
This project formed part of my Week 2 assignment during the FNB App Academy course. I worked through the fundamentals of CSS by applying styling techniques to enhance a simple webpage. The task helped solidify my understanding of how CSS can transform basic HTML into visually engaging layouts.

📘 What I Explored
Linking external stylesheets to HTML files

Customizing fonts, colors, and text alignment

Using background images and borders

Styling bullet lists and navigation menus

Applying hover effects for interactivity

Structuring content using div containers

🚀 How I Ran It
I cloned the project locally and opened index.html in the browser. All the styling rules were added and adjusted inside style.css to reflect the design goals set for the task.

📁 Project Files
index.html: Base HTML file I styled

style.css: CSS rules I created and modified

images/: Visual assets used for backgrounds and icons

I enjoyed experimenting with different styling elements and seeing how small changes could completely alter the look and feel of the page. This task definitely boosted my confidence in working with CSS.
